# RSA-Cracking-CS4770

Part 1: Implement RSA Encryption on an ASCII string fed to standard in, followed on a separate line by two integers representing e and n

o Our padding scheme will be to send exactly 1 byte at a time.  Put it in the least significant byte and pad with 0s.

o I don’t know a C++ function off the top of my head to do modular exponentiation, but it’s like a 5 line function to write.

o I recommend Python for this assignment

o Inverse modular exponentiation may be harder, I’ve never tried to write that.

Part 2: Write an RSA Cracker that receives an ASCII string fed to standard in (ciphertext), followed on a separate line by two integers representing e and n

o Fastest implementation gets a bonus point on their final grade.

o Don’t worry, we won’t use too large of numbers because I don’t want to sit around grading them all day.

o You are advised to test your code on a variety of keys to make sure it works.

o Will be formalized soon.

I hope to get you some test cases again
